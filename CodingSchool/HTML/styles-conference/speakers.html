                            <h5>Heavy Metal Coding</h5>
                            <p>I have no idea what Shay was thinking when he had this guy come to this conference, because frankly, I'm not sure what Heavy Metal and coding have to do with one another. The only frustration, other than positioning HTML elements, is that none of the copy has been provided for this page. This is a pretty copy heavy section of the website, and so I've got to fill it somehow. Shay, you're an HTML legend, but dude, please, keep your files up to date for the ends of the lessons. Thanks.</p>
                            <h5>About Chris</h5>
                            <p>Chris is probably some fictional dude that was created for this website. If not, sorry Chris, I'm sure you're a great guy. I've just been building this site for two days, and I'm not really in the mood for niceties, or however that's spelled. The next version of VSCode should definitely come with a spellcheck feature, or perhaps there's already an extension built out for this version. I'll take a look after I get done typing this gigantic paragraph. Sigh.</p>

                            <h5>Less is More: How Constraints Cultivate Growth</h5>
                            <p>"By setting constraints, we force ourselves..."<br><br>Yeah, so that was ALL the copy I was given for this section. Clearly, less is more here. Less copy, more mindless drivel from me. Hope you're enjoying this, whoever is on the receiving end of this webpage.</p>
                            <h5>About Shay</h5>
                            <p>Shay Howe is somebody that Raphy worked with at some point, and he developed this killer HTML course. That's the extent of knowledge I have on this guy. Similar to my plight regarding Chris Mills, I don't have any copy to paste into this section, so I've resorted to writing my own snarky copy. Please no one take offense to this, it's just filler, like my brain currently.</p>
